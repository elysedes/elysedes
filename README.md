- 👋 Hi, I’m @elysedes
  
- ✨ A lil about me: I’m interested in problem solving, coding, and knitting. I've been messing about with websites since I was a wee teen - starting out with editing CSS on livejournal pages, creating fan-sites for my favourite anime, and eventually managing wordpress sites for work. After going to school for Graphic Design, I fell in love with code all over again - building websites for fun and propelling my HTML and CSS skills to supplement my design career. I've recently gone back to school to learn more of the back-end of web development and improve my ability to both design abd build beautiful, functional website applications.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. I'm a practiced graphic designer with experience in front-end development. You can find me studying and practicing my back-end skills in BrainStation's Web Development Bootcamp.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a web product or design as a Junior Web Developer. My goal is to gain enough experience that I can launch my passion project: a web app for a niche market.

- ⚡ Fun fact: The Whiskey Jack (or Canada Jay) can be found in every one of Canada's provinces and territories. It's named after Wisakedjak, a benevolent trickster and hero of indigenous stories and mythology.
